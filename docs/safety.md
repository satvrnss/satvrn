As editors with nearly 10 years of experience and our own reputations to care for, we'd gain absolutely nothing by sharing harmful files. This is simply a for fun resource, and we do not profit off of it in any way. We do not accept donations, use shortlinks, etc.

False positives [(**definition**)](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/false-positive/) are not uncommon when pirating software, especially when it comes to Windows Defender, McAfee, or Norton. The majority of cracks have been modified or will modify the original software in order to bypass licensing, and sometimes this behavior can appear similar to behavior found in actual malware, and don't forget, is a crime!

You don't have to blindly trust our word, Google is free. **__Take initiative and research__** any detection you may have concerns about, and you'll find that most detections are not actual malware, but rather generic (PUP - *Potentially* Unwanted Program) and AI alerts that the app has been modified by to bypass licensing mechanisms.

**Ultimately, no one here is forcing you to use this page and we most certainly won’t beg for you to trust us.**  
You’re free to turn elsewhere, or better yet, pay for it. Pirating will always come with its share of risk, and it's your responsibility to be smart about it. Fearmongering is not allowed in our Discord.
